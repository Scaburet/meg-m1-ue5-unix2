RNAseq analysis course materials for Magistere of Genetics M2 course

This repository contains adapted Jupyter notebooks for RNAseq bioinformatic analysis, specifically designed for second-year Master's students in genetics. The course materials are structured in two parts:


1. Bash analysis pipeline for quality check, processing, mapping of RNAseq short reads and output checking 
2. R analysis pipeline for downstream analysis of expression data


## Development Workflow
This repository uses a feature branch workflow. Please create a new branch for each feature or bugfix.
